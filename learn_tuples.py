  # Tuples Practice #1
  # Use a tuple method to count the number of times the value 2 appears in the following tuple, and display the result (integer) on the screen:
  
  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2)
  print(my_tuple.count(2))
  # Tuples Practice #2
  # Convert the following tuple to a list, and store it in a variable called my_list.
  
  my_tuple1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2]
  my_list = my_tuple1
  print(my_tuple1)
  # Tuples Practice #3
  # Extract the elements of the following tuple into four variables: a, b, c, d
  
  my_tuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
  a, b, c, d = my_tuple2
  print(a)
  print(b)
  print(c)
  print(d)
